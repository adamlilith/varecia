# varecia

This repository contains code for modeling the vulnerability of Varecia variegata (the black-and-white ruffed lemur) and the Varecia rubra (the red ruffed lemur) in Madagascar to climate change and deforestation. The deforestation sub-model relies heavily on code from Viellendent et al. (2013) and data from Viellendent et al. (2018). The code uses R packages available on CRAN and the omnibus, enmSdm, legendary, statisfactory, and fasterRaster packages available from this account (adamlilith).

All code is provided for educational purposes only.
